Start doing following work and show me at every step.

Task1) For 5 numbers, Draw flowcharts and write java codes 
separately for following finding Maximum, Minimum, and 
Average. That is 3 flowcharts and 3 java codes.

Task2 ) combine flowcharts and javacodes of finding maximum and 
minimum from Task1 into 1 flowchart and 1 javacode. Hint: 
write same steps from both flowchart only once. If any line 
or any condition (along with yes/no part) is different, then 
write the different parts one after another.

Task3 ) combine flowcharts and javacodes of Task2 with finding 
average into 1 flowchart and 1 javacode

Those who completed everything in class, start from Task 4.
Others students, show all of the class work (D, A, B, C, D), then start from Task 4.
=======================================================
Task4) Draw flowchart and Write a Java program which adds all 
numbers that are multiples of both 7 and 9 up to 600.

Task5) Draw flowchart and Write a Java program which adds all 
numbers that are multiples of either 7 or 9 up to 600. 
Ensure that numbers like 63 are added only once in the sum.

Task6) Draw flowchart and Write a Java program which adds all 
numbers that are multiples of either 7 or 9 but not both, up to 600.

Task7) Draw flowchart and Write a Java program which takes a 
number and tells how many digits are in that number. 
Example: if user gives 9876, you should print 4.
Hint: keep dividing by ten and count how many times the 
could  be divided.
9876 by 10, is 987, count that got 1 digit
987 by 10, is 98, count that got 1 digit (total 2)
98 by 10, is 9, count that got 1 digit (total 3)
9 by 10, is 0, count that got 1 digit (total 4)
done!


Task8) Draw flowchart and Write a Java program which takes a 
number and prints the value of 10 to the power that number.
You need to use loop because variable in the power isn't allowed.
For example: if user gives 3, print 1000.
Hint: Keep multiplying 1 by 10, again and again, 3 (or n) times
like sum=sum+n, you need to write, product = product x 10
1 x 10 = 10
10 x 10 = 100
100 x 10 = 1000
1000 x 10 = 10000

===============================================
Until you are confident in for-loop,
For all tasks below, first show me while-loop version, 
and if the solution is found to be correct, 
then show me the same program again but using for-loop instead of while-loop.

In the end, you should solve of all the following using for-loop
===============================================


Task9) Draw flowchart and Write a Java program which takes a 
number and prints the digits from unit place, then tenth, then hundredth, etc.
Example: if user gives 32768, then print 8, 6, 7, 2, 3
Hint: Taking remainder/modulus of division by 10. 
After printing the remainder, drop the last digit by 
dividing by 10. Then start over.

32,768 % 10 = 8
32,768 / 10 = 3, 276

3, 276 % 10 = 6
3, 276 / 10 = 327

327 % 10 = 7
327 / 10 = 32

32 % 10 = 2
32 / 10 = 3

3 % 10 = 3
3 / 10 = 0


Task10) Draw flowchart and Write a Java program which takes a 
number and prints the digits from left to right.
Example: if user gives 32768, then print 3, 2, 7, 6, 8
Hint: count how many digits
calculate 10 to the power that (number of digits) minus 1. 
Say, 32768 has 5 digits, 
so you calculate 10 to the power 4 which is 10,000. 
Then divide 32,768 by 10,000 and thus you get 3.
take remainder of 32,768 by 10,000 and thus you get 2,768
Then divide 10,000 by 10 to get 1,000
Then divide 2,768 by 1,000 and thus you get 2.
take remainder of 2,768 by 1,000 and thus you get 768
keep going on until there is no more digits left (zero!).
In short:
Loop 1: First count digits, say 5 in this case for 32,768
Loop 2: Then calculate 10 to the power 4 (5-1), that is 10,000. 
Loop 3: Then repeat following three steps

32,768 / 10,000 = 3
32,768 % 10,000 = 2,768
10,000/10 = 1,000

2,768 / 1,000 = 2
2,768 % 1,000 = 768
1,000/10 = 100

768 / 100 = 7
768 % 100 = 68
100/10 = 10

68 / 10 = 6
68 % 10 = 8
10/10 = 1

8 / 1 = 8
8 % 1 = 0
1/10 = 0


Task11) Telling words: Draw flowchart and write javacode of a 
program that takes a number between 0 and 9. You have to 
print that number in words.
Hint: if n == 1, then print "one"
else if n == 2, then print "two"

Task12) Combine Task 10 and 11 into a single flowchart and java 
program so that it can tell any number in words. 
Example: If user gives 932, print nine three two.

Task13) Draw flowchart and write java code of a program that
takes a number and prints all numbers up to that number.
If the user gives 8, print 1 to 8.

Task14) Draw flowchart and write java code of a program that
takes a number and counts how many times that number can be 
divided by all numbers up to that number (Those numbers are 
also known as factors)
If the user gives 8, tries to divide 8 by each of 1 to 8
and count how many times it could be divided.
For example: 
If user enters 8,
try to divide 8 by 1, its divisible (increase count to 1)
try to divide 8 by 2, its divisible (increase count to 2)
try to divide 8 by 3, its NOT divisible
try to divide 8 by 4, its divisible (increase count to 3)
try to divide 8 by 5, its NOT divisible
try to divide 8 by 6, its NOT divisible
try to divide 8 by 7, its NOT divisible
try to divide 8 by 8, its divisible (increase count to 4)
Now print the count which is 4 in this case.


Task15) If a number is NOT divisible any number other than 1
and itself, then it is called prime number. 
For example, 13 is a prime number because it is NOT
divisible by any number other than 1 and 13 (itself).
Take one number from the user and tell if it is prime number or not.
Hint: Use the technique from Task14 and count factors of the 
input. Factors are those numbers between 1 and n that can 
divide the number, n. If there are more than two factors (1 
and n), then the number, n is not prime because it was 
divisible by other numbers.


Task16) Modify Task15, instead of counting factors, 
print sum of factors.

Task17) Modify Task15, calculate sum of factors less than 
the number itself. If the sum equals to the number, then 
print that the number is a perfect number.
Example: User enters n = 6. Factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3.
Sum of those factors 1+2+3=6 which is same as the number 6(n).
So, print that 6 is a perfect number.
Example2: If user enters 8. Factors of 8 are 1, 2, 4.
1+2+4=7 (NOT equal to 8).
So, print that 8 is NOT a perfect number.

Task18) Ask user for a range. Count how many numbers are prime number
and how many numbers are perfect numbers between that range.
For example, between 2 and 6 there are 3 prime numbers (2, 3, 5) 
and 1 perfect number (6).

Sample Input:
2 6
Sample Output:
Between 2 and 6,
Found 3 prime numbers
Found 1 perfect number.


Task19) Assume that we have the following array contains 
marks of 5 students.
int[] marks = new int[] {10, 30, 20, 50, 40};
Find the max, min, average mark.
Output:
Highest mark is 50
Lowest mark is 10
Average mark is 30

Task20) Assume that we have the following array contains marks.
int[] marks = new int[] {10, 30, 20, 50, 40};
Find how many students are better than average.
Output:
2 students are better than average.
They received following marks
50
40

Hint: First calculate average marks. Then loop through the marks
array and count how many marks are greater than average.
Print this count. Then again, loop through the marks and count
how many elements were greater than average marks.

Task21) Assume that we have the following array.
int[] a = new int[] {10, 30, 20, 50, 40};
Find the largest number and print it along with its location.
Output:
Largest number is 50
Largest number was found at location 3


Task22) Assume that we have the following array.
int[] a = new int[] {10, 30, 20, 50, 40};

Modify Task21. Swap the first number with largest number.
Your output should be 50, 30, 20, 10, 40

Hint:
Find largestNumber and largestNumberLocation.
backup = a[0];
a[0]=largestNumber;
a[largestNumberLocation]=backup;


Task23) Assume that we have the following array.
int[] a = new int[] {50, 30, 20, 10, 40};
Modify Task22.

Find largest number among all numbers between 2nd and 
last number (30, 20, 10, 40).
Swap the 2nd number with this largest number. 
Thus you just put 2nd largest in 2nd position.

Task24) Combine ideas from Task 22 and 23. 
Ask the user for a number n, and then find nth highest number 

Hint: 
Repeat the idea (from task 22,23) n times. 
Then you will find nth highest number in nth position in array.

Task 26) Find median among some numbers. 
Ask user how many numbers and input those numbers.

Definition of Median:
For example, if a < b < c, then the median of the list {a, b, c} is b, 
and, if a < b < c < d, then the median
 of the list {a, b, c, d} is the mean of b and c; 
i.e., it is (b + c)/2.

Hint:
Sort numbers
if there are odd number of numbers, say 9, then 
the median is the middle number, at 5th position

if there are even number of numbers, say 10, then 
the median is average of two middle numbers, (5th+6th)/2

Sample Input 1:
5
10 50 40 20 30
Sample Output 1:
30
Sample Input 2:
6
10 50 40 20 30 60
Sample Output 2:
35
